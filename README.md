## 🎬🎮📖 About Me

Expert in Film. Student in Computer Science.  Soon to be a expert in both.

Hi, I'm Adam! I'm currently looking for Software Development internships in the New York State area. I have an interest in most technical fields, but I am currently focusing on full stack web development, game development, and software development. In my free time, I work on films with my production company "The Golden Cut". My expertise lies in being a director of photography, and I am applying those skills to learn Java, Web Development, Unreal Engine and C++. 

Most people describe me as a funny, kind, and hardworking individual who values their time and works efficiently. Message me if you love videogames, board games, anime, magic the gathering, basketball, film, or books. Thank you!

## 🛠 Skills
C++, Unreal Engine, Raylib, Film-making.
